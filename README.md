# Imagine Parking App

## Overview

This project is a REST API backend for a parking management system. It provides various endpoints for user
authentication, managing user profiles, handling parking sessions, payments, and more. Additionally, it includes a
health checker endpoint to ensure the database's functionality.

## Main Features

### User Authentication and Management

- **User Authentication**: Users can securely sign up, log in, and log out using JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.
  The access token is blacklisted for the duration of its existence upon logout.
- **User Registration**: New users can register accounts with unique credentials. The first user in the system is always
  the administrator.
- **User Profile Management**: Users can update their profiles, including username, email, and password. They can also
  view and edit information about themselves through different routes.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Operations are filtered based on user roles, allowing only authorized users to perform
  certain actions such as updating profiles or changing user roles. There are three roles: regular user, moderator, and
  administrator.
- **Password Management**: Users can reset and change their passwords.

### Role-Based Access Control

- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Operations throughout the platform are filtered based on user roles, ensuring that
  only authorized users can perform specific actions.
- **Administrator Privileges**: Administrators have the highest level of access, allowing them to manage users,
  sessions, and payments.
- **Users Roles**: Roles include regular user (client), operator, and administrator, each with different levels of
  access and
  permissions.

### Vehicle Management

- **Vehicle Blacklist Management**:
    - Admins can add vehicles to a blacklist, preventing them from accessing parking spaces.
    - Admins can view a list of blacklisted vehicles and their information.
    - Admins can update blacklist entries for blacklisted vehicles.
- **Vehicle Reminder System**:
    - Admins can send email reminders to vehicle owners about upcoming parking session expirations.
    - Reminders are based on a configurable number of days before the session ends.
- **Vehicle Information Export**:
    - Admins can export parking data (including parking sessions, payments, and vehicle information) to a CSV file for a
      specified date range.
    - The exported data can be used for further analysis or record-keeping purposes.
- **Vehicle Abonement Status**:
    - Admins can view a list of vehicles with active parking abonement.

### Parking Management

- **Session Management**: Operator can create, update, and close parking sessions.
- **Payment Processing**: Operator can process payments for parking sessions, including checking for existing payments
  and
  calculating fees based on session durations and abonement statuses.
- **Export Parking Data**: Administrators can export parking session data.
- **View Parking Session Details**: Users can view details about their parking sessions.

### Rate Management

- **Create, Update, and Delete Rates**: Administrators can manage parking rates.
- **Retrieve Rate Information**: Users can view rate details.

### Settings Management

- **Create, Update, and Delete Settings**: Administrators can manage system settings.
- **Retrieve Settings**: Users can view system settings.

### Health Checker

- **Database Health Check**: An endpoint is available to check the health of the database connection.

### Security and Performance

- **Token-Based Authentication**: Authentication tokens are used to securely authenticate users and protect sensitive
  operations.
- **Rate Limiting**: Operations are rate-limited to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources.
- **CORS Middleware**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware is implemented to allow controlled access to
  resources from different origins, enhancing security.

## Plate Number Recognition

**Overview**

This section details the implementation and performance of the plate number recognition system. The system leverages a
combination of image processing techniques and a deep learning model to accurately identify and extract license plate
numbers from images.

**Model Architecture and Training**

* **Model Architecture:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed for character recognition. The model consists
  of multiple convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers to extract relevant features. Fully connected layers
  classify the extracted features into corresponding characters.
* **Training Data:** The model is trained on a custom dataset of license plate images and their corresponding character
  labels. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, and shearing are applied to increase the dataset's
  diversity and improve generalization.
* **Training Process:** The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer. Early stopping is
  implemented to prevent overfitting.

**Working in the App**

1. **Image Preprocessing:** The input image is preprocessed to enhance the visibility of the license plate. This
   includes grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and edge detection.
2. **Plate Detection:** Using Haar cascades, the system detects regions of interest that likely contain license plates.
3. **Character Segmentation:** The detected plate region is segmented into individual characters.
4. **Character Recognition:** Each segmented character is fed into the trained CNN model to predict its corresponding
   class.
5. **Plate Number Reconstruction:** The predicted characters are concatenated to form the final license plate number.

**Accuracy and Results**

* **Accuracy Metrics:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and
  F1-score.
* **Visualization:** The system provides visualizations of the detected license plates and their corresponding
  recognized characters.
* **Error Analysis:** Common errors and their causes are analyzed to improve the system's performance.
