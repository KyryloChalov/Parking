# Imagine Parking app

## Overview

This project is a REST API backend for ______. It provides various endpoints for
user authentication, managing user profiles, _____, as
well as a health checker endpoint to ensure the database's functionality.

## Main Features

### User Authentication and Management

- **User Authentication**: Users can securely sign up, log in, and log out using JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.
  The access token is blacklisted for the duration of its existence upon logout.
- **User Registration**: New users can register accounts with unique credentials. The first user in the system is always
  the administrator.
- **User Profile Management**: Users can update their profiles, including username, email, and password. They can also
  view and edit information about themselves through different routes.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Operations are filtered based on user roles, allowing only authorized users to perform
  certain actions such as updating profiles or changing user roles. There are three roles: a regular user, a moderator,
  and an administrator.

### Role-Based Access Control

- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Operations throughout the platform are filtered based on user roles, ensuring that
  only authorized users can perform specific actions.
- **Administrator Privileges**: _________
- **Users Roles**: ________

### Health Checker

- **Database Health Check**: An endpoint is available to check the health of the database connection.

### Security and Performance

- **Token-Based Authentication**: Authentication tokens are used to securely authenticate users and protect sensitive
  operations.
- **Rate Limiting**: Operations are rate-limited to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources.
- **CORS Middleware**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware is implemented to allow controlled access to
  resources from different origins, enhancing security.

## Installation and Deployment

This section contains the description of the different ways you can install and/or deploy the Image application.

**Options:**

1. **Installation by Cloning Git Repository**
2. **Installation by Downloading and running [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/imagineteam/parkingapp) from
   dockerhub**
3. **Run Already Deployed Application in a browser**

Detailed instructions for each option follow:

## Installation by Cloning Git Repository

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Docker
